Description: Cross-platform network file transfer application
 NitroShare is designed to make transferring any file to any device as painless
 as possible.
 .
 NitroShare uses a JSON-based protocol that is both platform and
 architecture-neutral to transfer files as efficiently as possible.
 .
 IPv4 broadcast is used for automatically discovering other devices on the local
 network running NitroShare. This enables files and entire directories to be
 instantly transferred to the other devices.
 .
 Because the application is only able to transfer data between devices on the
 same network, data in transit is not encrypted.
